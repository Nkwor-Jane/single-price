## Overview
I used HTML and CSS to build the Single Price Grid Component from Frontend Mentors

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I put all the colors in root variables. I used CSS Grid for the first time. This might be small project, but a lot of research was done to understand the concepts of CSS Grid. It was a good experience. I will try to incorporate more in my future projects.

Code Snippet: Some of my CSS 

```
.singleGrid{
    box-shadow: 0 3px 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2);
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);
    margin-top: 4rem;
    border-radius: 10px;
    width: 60%;
}
```

### Continued development

I will focus on bulding projects from Frontend Mentor challenges and personal projects for personal development.

### Useful resources
